# LEI Data

This script will convert the concatenated data files from the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) into the `followthemoney` format. GLEIF publishes a set of files that describe all companies which have been issued an LEI, and some ownership relationships between them.

The finished data is uploaded to S3 and available from:

* https://data.opensanctions.org/contrib/gleif/gleif.json
